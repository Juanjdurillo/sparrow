#Sparrow 

Sparrow is a Master-Worked like framework written in Java which aims to facilitate distributed computing on clusters.

Sparrow was first developed as support software for the scientific pulication: Durillo, Juan J., et al. "A study of master-slave approaches to parallelize NSGA-II." Parallel and Distributed Processing, 2008. IPDPS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on. IEEE, 2008. 

This repository aims to bring Sparrow back in track, update it, and possibly use it for other applications different from the original one.
